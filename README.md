Implementation of combinational logic gates
 
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
 F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy
 
 
 
## Equipments Required:
Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher Software – Quartus prime


## Theory

A combinational circuit is a circuit in which the output depends on the present combination of inputs. Combinational circuits are made up of logic gates. The output of each logic gate is determined by its logic function. Combinational circuits can be made using various logic gates, such as AND gates, OR gates and NOT gates. 
 

## Procedure:

1.Create a project with required entities.

2.Create a module along with respective file name.

3.Run the respective programs for the given boolean equations.

4.Run the module and get the respective RTL outputs.

5.Create university program(VWF)for getting timing diagram.

6.Give the respective inputs for timing diagram  and obtain the results.
## Program:

Program to implement the given logic function and to verify its operations in quartus using Verilog programming.
